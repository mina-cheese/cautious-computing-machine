using cautious computing machine to recklessly guess cluster primes (not really)

Algorithm is taken from the paper Cluster Primes by Richard Blecksmith, Paul Erdős, and J. L. Selfridge. (JSTOR 2589585). 

I've done by best to recreate it here with some (hopefully) clearer explanations on how the algorithm is implemented.
